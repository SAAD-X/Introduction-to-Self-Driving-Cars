MODULE 2 : GRADED QUIZ



1. What are the differences between exteroceptive sensors and proprioceptive sensors? (Select all that apply)

**Ans : **

 Proprioceptive sensors can determine distance travelled by the vehicle, whereas exteroceptive sensors cannot.
 Proprioceptive sensors do not interact with the environment, whereas exteroceptive sensors do. (correct)
 Exteroceptive sensors can determine obstacle size and distance away, whereas proprioceptive sensors cannot. (correct)
 Exteroceptive sensors can determine distance traveled by the vehicle, whereas proprioceptive sensors cannot.
 Proprioceptive sensors are used to determine vehicle position, whereas exteroceptive sensors are used for sensing the environment.



2. Which of the following exteroceptive sensors would you use in harsh sunlight?

**Ans : **

 Cameras
 Radar (correct)
 Sonar (correct)
 Lidar



3. Why is synchronization and timing accuracy important in the self driving system? Choose the primary reason.

**Ans : **

 Synchronization is important to check sensor failure.
 Synchronization is important to ensure that sensors measure the environment at the same time.
 Synchronization is important to ensure correct sensor fusion. (correct)
 Synchronization is important to ensure organized computation.



4. Your autonomous vehicle is driving on the German autobahn at 150 km/h and you wish to maintain safe following distances with other vehicles. Assuming a safe following distance of 2s, what is the distance (in m) required between vehicles? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.

**Ans : ** 83.33




5. Using the same speed of 150 km/h, what is the braking distance (in m) required for emergency stops? Assume an aggressive deceleration of 5 m/s^2. Round your answer to 2 decimal places.

**Ans : ** 173.61




6. Suppose your vehicle was using long range cameras for sensing forward distance, but it is now nighttime and the images captured are too dark. Which of the following sensors can be used to compensate?

**Ans : **

 Radar (correct)
 Lidar (correct)
 Sonar
 IMU



7. What are the differences between an occupancy grid and a localization map? (Select all that apply)

**Ans : **

 The occupancy grid only contains static objects, while the localization map contains only dynamic objects.
 The localization map uses only lidar data, whereas the occupancy grid can use both lidar and camera data.
 An occupancy grid uses a dense representation of the environment, whereas a localization map does not need to be dense. (correct)
 The localization map is primarily used toestimate the vehicle position, whereas the occupancy grid is primarily used to plan collision free paths. (correct)



8. The vehicle steps through the software architecture and arrives at the controller stage. What information is required for the controller to output its commands to the vehicle?

**Ans : **

 Vehicle state (correct)
 Locations of obstacles and other vehicles
 Planned paths (correct)
 Environment maps



9. What is (are) the role(s) of the system supervisor? (Select all that apply)

**Ans : **

 To ensure that the sensors are working correctly (correct)
 To ensure that the maps update at the correct frequencies (correct)
 To ensure that the controller outputs are within operating range
 To ensure that the planned paths are collision free



10. Which of the following tasks should be assigned to the local planner?

**Ans : **

 Planning a lane change to turn left
 Planning a merge onto the highway
 Planning to avoid a parked car in the ego vehicle's lane (correct)
 Planning a route to a destination



11. What common objects in the environment appear in the occupancy grid?

**Ans : **

 Traffic lights
 Lane boundaries
 Other moving vehicles
 Parked vehicles (correct)



12. Which of the following maps contain roadway speed limits?

**Ans : **

 Occupancy grid
 Localization map
 Detailed roadmap (correct)
